# Unsupervised Learning with R
This course begins with the fundamentals of PHP programming by covering the basic concepts such as variables, functions, class, and objects. You will set up PHP server on your machine and learn to read and write procedural PHP code. After getting an understanding of OOP as a paradigm, you will execute MySQL queries on your database. Moving on, you will find out how to use MVC to create applications from scratch and add tests. Then, you will build REST APIs and perform behavioral tests on your applications.By the end of the book, you will have the skills required to read and write files, debug, test, and work with MySQL.


## What you will learn
* Clustering using the top 3 clustering methods: k-means, agglomerative, and divisive.
* Applications of clustering methods to real problems: students will write their own code to cluster a real dataset.
* Market basket analysis: students will be able to write code to analyze market segmentation and consumer behavior rules.
* Kernel density estimation: how to estimate the distribution and probabilities of different outcomes.
* Principal component analysis, the top method used currently for dimension reduction
* Anomaly detection methods, including how to apply them to fraud detection.
* Diagnostics for each of the models we cover, including how best to apply them to real-world issues.
* R code for each of our algorithms, and skills for how to edit and improve the code
